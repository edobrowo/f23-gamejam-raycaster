# S23 Game Jam Raycaster
2D raycast engine written in C++ as part of the Spring 2023 UW Game Dev Club Game Jam.
The plan was to expand it into a procedurally generated walking simulator. I never got around to it in this project, however I do want to re-write the engine with SDL (which is much more sensible than using an old version of OpenGL). Alternatively I may just go right to BSP instead. 
# Controls
W/S - move forward/backward
A/D - turn left/right
